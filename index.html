            </h1>
            <p>
              >  Maharani Ahilyabai Holkar (31 May 1725 â€“ 13 August 1795) was the Holkar Queen of the Maratha Malwa kingdom, India. Rajmata Ahilyabai was born in the village of Chondi in Jamkhed, Ahmednagar, Maharashtra. She moved the capital to Maheshwar south of Indore on the Narmada River.<br><br>
              > Ahilyabai's husband Khanderao Holkar was killed in the battle of Kumbher in 1754. Twelve years later, her father-in-law, Malhar Rao Holkar, died. A year after that she was crowned as the queen of the Malwa kingdom. She tried to protect her kingdom from plundering invaders. She personally led armies into battle. She appointed Tukojirao Holkar as the Chief of Army.<br><br>

              >Ahilyabai was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi, in the present-day Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra. Her father, Mankoji Rao Shinde, was the Patil of the village. Women then did not go to school, but Ahilyabai's father taught her to read and write.<br><br>

                Great is my country India
                where Ahilya is born
                never heard of a woman so inspiring
                never read about a woman so great
                it is for everybody to learn
                bravery, confidence & skills of administration
                selfless work with divine splendour
                facts and figures tell the truth
                married at the age of eight
                widow at twentyone
                self-immolation(sati) prevented by father-in-law
                father-in-law expired twelve years after
                few months later her only son died
                nobody can just think of her tragedy
                during those days
                when society dominated by men
                She became Queen of Malwa in 1767
                emotional setbacks overpowered by 'Karma Yoga'
                the kingdom belongs to Lord Shiva, she declared
                'I am just a role-player'
                a perfect blend of
                rationality and spirituality
                what a greatness in her thoughts!
                she defeated her enemies with iron hand
                even the British scared of her
                lawlessness nipped in the bud
                welfare of people, her prime aim
                she established capital city at Maheshwar
                named after Lord Shiva
                on the bank of river Narmada
                two hours drive from Indore
                trade and commerce flourished
                she conducted daily meet of people
                listened to their grievances:
                her patronage of literature
                music, sculpture, art and crafts
                the bounty of agriculture
                textile industry at its peak
                the 'maheshwari' brand of sarees
                exist today also
                her generous donations for temples
                out of her personal earnings
                stand out as a pious example
                from Dwaraka to Puri
                from Kashi to Rameswaram
                she renovated many temples
                many a bathing ghats established
                but ensured communal harmony
                her thirty years of golden rule
                a model for governance world wide
                people worshipped her as 'devi'
                was she not a deity?
                the greatest setback came
                when her daughter jumped into
                the funeral pyre 'sati'
                when her son-in-law was killed
                but she was unable to stop this
                she left forever at the age of seventy
                with her demise
                India lost an angel
                what was her driving force?
                surrendering everything to God
                working without expectation
                thinking of welfare of people
                the waves of river Narmada
                providing her with the silent energy
                and all her decisions
                perhaps dictated by Lord Shiva...
                <b>"Ahilya"</b> shall remain immortal
                as an inspiring icon for mankind.
